            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe Scriptures of God in ſundry places doe manifeſtly declare vnto vs the healthfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of afflictions, in calling them a cup, or drinking glaſſe: for like as the expert Phiſition giuing vnto his patient ſuch quantity of medicine as he thinketh good, the patient muſt of neceſſity yeeld the choice of his fancie to the
<pb facs="tcp:29346:102"/> ſkilfull prouidence of him that miniſtreth: euen ſo our good and gratious Lord, knowing farre better what is profitable and moſt expedient to cure the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities &amp; maladies of our ſoules, tameth our affections with ſuch cups of afflictions as his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wiſedome in mercie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth to be moſt behooueable for vs. In like manner are they alſo called in another ſence his artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, his ſpeares and his ſwords, wherewith to fight and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his enemies: and euen as theſe definitions touching their ends are not alike, but very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, ſo likewiſe are the afflictions of God ſent both to the godly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29346:102"/> and vngodly, but to two ſundrie ends, for by the one ſort of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God exerciſeth the patience of the faithfull handling them for the moſt part more roughly than he doth the wicked The other he vſeth both to teſtifie vnto vs, that iniquitie cannot raigne vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable, as alſo to hold them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, and that is the full end of all afflictions, extended to the infidell or reprobate. The cuppes therefore and afflictions of God, as they are not ſent to all men to one end, ſo do they not worke one effect, but for all them the lewd perſon remaineth ſtill vngodly, ſicke he was before he tooke the medicine, and in like manner ſicke
<pb facs="tcp:29346:103"/> or rather more vncurable he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth foreward after it, he feeleth himſelfe ſmitten, but conſidereth not in truth who ſmote him, ſo exceeding farre is he from the perfect peruſing of his owne life, and oueruiweing of his former daies thereby, he imputeth his croſſe to fortune, rather than ſmelleth his owne ſinnes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to change his life, and if his croſſe endure but a little, he chafeth at God and reiecteth his corrections, he amendeth not at all but waxeth worſe and worſe: farre contrarie is the effect of thoſe afflictions which Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſuſtaine, for his children ſo ſoone as they feele his croſſe by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29346:103"/> any meanes layed vpon them, they by and by without delay bethinke themſelues of their ſinnes, remembring that the hand of God is come vpon them for the ſame in which feare with all humilitie and reuerent trembling caſting downe euery height with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, they throw themſelues flatlong at the footſtoole of Gods Maieſtie, reckoning vp all their hainous crimes to their power, acknowledging their faults, and beſeeching God in mercie to giue them a feeling of their ſinnes, that he will pierce their eares, and in ſuch wiſe open them, that their affliction may turne to the comfort of their conſciences: this
<pb facs="tcp:29346:104"/> caſe is cleane contrarie (as is ſaid) to the fearefull puniſhments of the reprobate, they being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened like Pharao thereby, for lacke of his ſecond grace, which is the ſoftening of mans heart and ſoberneſſe of his nature by the holy Ghoſt, from the free goodneſſe of our eternall God. Thoſe being opened in their hearts by ſuch grace and feeling of Gods chaſtiſements, are ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily taught to miſlike of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for their looſe life and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, to ſigh and grone for them, and to flie to the mercie of God for refuge. Now by theſe confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences appeareth a certaine rule or touchſtone, (not without an
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29346:104"/> vnſpeakeable comfort) to Gods elect, for in as much as God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Pharao, and ſoftened not his heart withall, he intended to leaue him inexcuſable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued deſtruction, but in that he afflicted Iob, he did it to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of his life, mollifying his heart to his ſaluation: and hence we gather two points of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to be noted and obſerued: the one is, that when God maketh vs to feele his hand, ſo that we are humbled vnder the ſame, it is a ſpeciall priuiledge and ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his good will, and which he neuer ſheweth to any but to his owne children: and the other is, ſince we are puniſhed but to

               </gap>eth our ſaluation: and thus we ſee (as S. Paule ſaith) our victorie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in taking hold of this loue of God in Ieſus Chriſt, being euermore throughly perſwaded,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29346:105"/> that God hath adopted vs to bee his children and heires of his kingdome, which principle wee once hauing, ought not to be led aſide nor diſmayed with any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, for ſeeing that God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſuch exceeding loue towards vs, we ſhall neuer be confounded, and ſo little in very deed ſhall our afflictions hinder our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, that they ſhall turne to our furtherance, and vndoubtfully prooue vnto vs, that Chriſt his yoake is ſweet and eaſie, and not onely bringeth vs to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods will, but to eternall happines. Thus afflictions are in truth our medicines to driue vs to God, to tame the pride of our
<pb facs="tcp:29346:106"/> nature, to kill our vices, to make vs know our ſelues, loath our ſinnes vnfainedly, flie from our owne waies, ſeeke ſtrength of the Lord, and ſo from vertue to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue aſcend to the height of our ſaluation: Finally, as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient reprobate they are the fearefull comets of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo to the number of Gods elect they are the infallibly pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſure enſignes of their continuall victory and future tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in Ieſus Chriſt. The life and healthfull afflictions of Iob and Dauid in aboundont manner do teſtifie the louing end of Gods afflictions, and in them may we find infinit teſtimonies, to prooue
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29346:106"/> how profitable are the fatherly chaſtiſements of our good God, who by them dooth euermore ſcoure vs from the ruſt of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſition, and fineth vs like pure gold in the furnace: briefely, by them he violently breaketh into the heart of old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and there burſting the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ends and coates of his veines, by his wonderfull opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion powreth a new ſpirit into his arteries, which creeping through the ſences with a liuely moiſture, as by a certaine heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Analogie or proportion, doth in ſettet ſort diſpoſe vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne this vile place of miſerie, and to eleuate our minds to God,

<pb facs="tcp:29346:159"/> can to diſturbe it. They which be friends, and louers of the biſhop of Rome, although they eate the fat of the land, and haue the beſt preferments and offices, and liue moſt at eaſe and alle nothing: yet are they not therewith content. They grudge, they mutter and murmure, they conſpire and take on againſt vs. It fretteth them that we liue by them or with them, and cannot abide that we ſhould draw the bare breathing of the aire, when they haue all the moſt libertie of the land. And albeit thy ſingular goodneſſe hath giuen them a King, ſo calme, ſo patient, ſo mercifull, more like a naturall father than a Prince
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29346:159"/> to gouerne ouer them, ſuch as neither they nor their anceſtors euer read of in the ſtories of this land before: yet all this will not calme them, their vnquiet ſpirit is not yet content, they repine and rebell, and needes would haue with the frogs of Eſope a Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, an Italian ſtranger, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, to play Rex ouer them, and care not if all the world were ſet on fire, ſo they with their Italian Lord might raigne alone. So fond are we Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ſtrange &amp; forraine things: ſo vnaturall to our ſelues: ſo greedie of newfangled nouelties, neuer contented with any ſtate long to continue, be it neuer ſo
<pb facs="tcp:29346:160"/> good: and furthermore ſo cruell one to another, that we thinke our life vnquiet, vnleſſe it be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the blood of other. For that is their hope, that is their golden day, their day of Iubiley which they thirſt for ſo much not to haue the Lord to come in the clouds, but to haue our bloud and to ſpill our liues.</p>
            <p>That, that is it which they would haue, and long ſince would haue had their wils vpon vs, had not thy gratious pittie and mercie raiſed vp to vs this our mercifull King, thy ſeruant Iames, ſomewhat to ſtay their furie. For whom as me moſt condignly giue thee moſt heartie
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29346:160"/> thankes, ſo likewiſe we beſeech thy heauenly Maieſtie, that as thou haſt giuen him vnto vs, and haſt from many daungers preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to the comfort of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: ſo now in his royall eſtate he may continually be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued not onely from their hands but from all malignant deuiſes, wrought attempted, or conceiued of the enemies, both ghoſtly and bodily againſt him. In this his gouernment be his gouernour we beſeech thee: So ſhall his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie well gouerne vs, if firſt he be gouerned by thee. Multiplie his raigne with many daies, and his yeares with much felicitie, with aboundance of peace, and life
<pb facs="tcp:29346:161"/> ghoſtly: that he with his Braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes may flouriſh in this land, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the conſummation of the world.</p>
            <p>And becauſe no gouernment can long ſtand without good counſell, neither can any counſell be good, except it be proſpered by thee, bleſſe therefore, we beſeech thee, both his maieſtie, and his honourable counſell, that both they rightly may vnderſtand what is to be done, and he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly may accompliſh that they doe counſell, to thy glory and furtherance of thy Goſpell, and publicke wealth of this realme.</p>
            <p>In generall, giue to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the whole ſtate of this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29346:161"/> Realme ſuch brotherly vnitie in knowledge of thy truth, and ſuch obedience to their ſuperiours, as they neither prouoke the ſcourge of God againſt them, nor the Princesſword to be drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will out of the ſcabard of long ſufferance, where it hath beene long hid, eſpecially giue thy goſpell long continuance amongſt vs. And if our ſinnes haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the contrarie, graunt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee with an earneſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that which is paſt, to ioine a heartie purpoſe of amendment to come.</p>
